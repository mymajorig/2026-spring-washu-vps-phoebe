            <h1>Phoebe's Interview</h1>
            <p>This interview examines how people perceive websites through logical versus creative lenses. Some users prioritize structure, clarity, and efficiency, while others focus on aesthetics, originality, and emotional impact. By exploring these differences, the study aims to better understand how design choices influence user experience and how websites can be made more intuitive and engaging for diverse thinking styles.</p>

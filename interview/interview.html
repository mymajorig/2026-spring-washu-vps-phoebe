            <h1>Phoebe's Interview</h1>
            <p>This interview examines how people perceive websites through logical versus creative lenses. Some users prioritize structure, clarity, and efficiency, while others focus on aesthetics, originality, and emotional impact. By exploring these differences, the study aims to better understand how design choices influence user experience and how websites can be made more intuitive and engaging for diverse thinking styles.</p>

            <p>"creative thinking is divergent, imaginative, and 'right-brain' oriented, aiming to generate novel ideas, break patterns, and explore possibilities" </p>

                <p>“How <b>navigable it is</b>. Normally I don't go on a website to just look at it, normally I go because I need something and I’m looking for something. I shouldn't have to go through 8 million steps to find the section that I need”</p>

            <h2>Do you interpret design elements symbolically (as expressive choices) or functionally (as usability tools)?</h2>

                <p>“It depends but <b>mostly symbolically</b>. I think if its color or background or something is very obviously decorative I think that it is symbolic. But when it comes to a toolbar or articles or links that they choose to showcase, I that it is more functional”</p>

            <h2>Can you recall a website where aesthetic design altered your emotional state or trust level? How?</h2>

                <p>“Literally today. I went onto booking.com and everything is so <b>overwhelming on the front page</b>. It’s neon yellow, there’s a city in the background there are words everywhere and it was so insanely overwhelming that I immediately left the website.”</p>

                <p>“Again, it depends. <b>When it comes to more creative elements, I consider it innovative.</b> When it comes to functionality, it’s like suddenly no one knows how to do it anymore and it becomes inconvenient.”</p>

            <h1>Logical Thinking</h1>
            <p>"Logical thinking is analytical, linear, and convergent, focusing on facts, rules, and finding the single best solution, often labeled as 'left-brain' thinking." </p>

                <p>““I guess the <b>UI and the design</b>. How old it looks, how organized it is. The colors, the layout of it and whether it is too simple, too flashy, or somewhere in between”</p>

                <p>“Functionally, only because when I open a website <b>I'm trying to find the information as quickly as possible.</b> I want to be able to have a menu that makes it easy to find information. Even the things that are kind of expressive, they serve a purpose like the colors and the layout. Its there for a reason and i feel like there is a function for all of those”</p>

                <p>“One of the websites I was using for studying help had really bad and<b> really outdated UI.</b> The design had a lot of urls everywhere and was not well organized. It was just really out of date. Even though I later found out that it was a secure site, I just felt like I was going to get viruses from the website and I didn’t feel like I could trust the information from it.”</p>

                <p>“I experience it as <b>something disorienting</b> because when I'm using a website, I want to be able to find the information and I'm using it for a purpose. If it's not something that's streamlined or easy to use then it takes me longer to play around and figure out how the website works and it just makes it more confusing rather than something new and helpful. Obviously there are times where it could be something new and innovative but most of the time I feel like it just doesn't work well.”</p>

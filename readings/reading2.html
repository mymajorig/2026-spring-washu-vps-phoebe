    <p>
        I like the idea of viewing the content of AI through the lens of expressiveness. I have always that that a difference between human and AI was that AI wasn’t able to understand humans like humans were able to understand other humans. 
        The idea of expression is a good way to add specificity to this idea. Similar to what the article said, I also think that AI can be expressive. How ever, its expression is only combining the ways we taught it how to be expressive. 
        This could make the work of AI more disjoint and easily distinguishable from raw human expression. I also liked the concept of AI being a “polar opposite of self” as it is only knowledgable on what humans teach it. It has the inability to develop its own unique patters based on its own unique experiences. I liked how the article pointed out that it also struggles with creating material from a particular context. Context can go deeper than certain years or decades, and I’m not sure if AI has the ability to create something expressive using more niche contexts. These facts are something that humans can definitely keep in mind when managing AI.

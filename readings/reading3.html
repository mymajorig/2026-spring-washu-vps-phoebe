    <p>I enjoyed the exploration of the two concepts Somaforming vs terraforming. I feel like the idea of ubiquitous computing is an idea thats too complex for the near future and I am personally not the biggest fan of it. This connects back to the pervious articles we have been reading about being able to distinguish the computers work from our own using human expression. If computing is all around us, it may be much more difficult for humans to have those original experiences that evoke said expression. In doing a deeper dive into AI glasses, I noticed that the glasses contain a camera that you can trigger to take photos. Although the camera is not always active, I feel like the idea of replacing your authentic vision with a more “photo-compatible” further tampers with the concept of authenticity and being in the moment. After reading this article I definitely think that, with VR and AI glasses, the society is approaching Somaforming state. However, things like Alexa are also evidence of terraforming contributions which makes me wonder which category of inventions will have the most influence on natural human society and habits. </p>

    <h2>Documentary response- Eno</h2>

    <p>This documentary made me not only think about the meaning of art but also had me reflect on how I incorporated artistic expression in my life. A lot of things stood out to me throughout the video, one element being the analysis of music and musical expression. There was one moment during the article where Eno had 3 different feelings when listening to a song but those feelings consisted of a place and a person that was entirely unrelated to said place. Oddly enough, I understood this feeling and have experienced it before but never sat with it enough to fully identify it. I also enjoyed hearing about the idea that the strongest human drive is to feel that you belong. I think, at the end of the day, that is the concept that all other potent drives connect to. One scene in that portion reminded me of the book “The History of Sound “where in one of the short stories, 2 people would go around collecting songs which would ensue this inadvertent sense of community. Additionally, there was one clip in the video that consisted of someone simply sitting in a chair with music playing in the background. I took a moment to see how compatible the music is with the scene and was reminded of our class discussion regarding how compatible a website is with the atmosphere of its corresponding physical place. </p>

    <p>I like the idea of a website being compared to a puddle. A good website is a subjective concept so one can never be truly complete. A websites evaporating slowly also reminds me of the concept of generational technology that was discussed in article concerning menu websites.
I feel like this article emphasizes the core meaning of a website which has led me to mentally compare the original intentions behind a website vs what a website has evolved to mean amongst the population today. In the plant comparison it states “But don’t get too excited or set goals: that’s not the idea here.” As much as I appreciate the approach, I feel like deadlines and time constraints have become a critical factor in the web development process whether for a job, assignment, or a personal project that you plan to display by a certain date. That being said, it’s factual that websites were not invented as something that should be rushed. This is why I like the rock comparison better. It treats the website as something that you can perpetually prototype but in a way where the ideas are doing more than drifting in your mind and waiting for the right moment.
Lastly, I appreciate the quote that emphasizes retransforming the web into something that can “reflect our hopes and fulfill our dreams, rather than magnify our fears and deepen our divisions”. Again this ties back to the core purpose of websites which were meant to display information and data in a way that brings people together not tears them apart.</p>

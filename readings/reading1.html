        I liked the statement “it was a generational website” and that it was a website of a specific time. I definitely appreciate the creativity and effort that goes into websites that are purely coded. At the same time I disagreed with the argument that claimed that not using templates causes people to have less creativity and expression. Especially when it comes to none coders there are so many people that want to express their restaurant through the website in certain ways but can’t bc they don’t know how to code. I think templates allow people more creativity because they take away the stress that can come from starting from scratch and the stress of learning how to code. Also, at the end of the day, the vibe of the restaurant is supposed to be shown through the actual place not the website. (I also wasn’t the biggest fan of the website shown at the beginning of the article and liked the Squarespace ones better).
